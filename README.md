## I. Installation

**Using `curl`**

```bash
<(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eaysin-dev/sync-workbench-api/main/scripts/setup.sh)
```

**Manual Method**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eaysin-dev/sync-workbench-api.git
   cd sync-workbench-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## II. Configuration

1. Create a .env file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Update the environment variables in .env:
   ```dotenv
   NODE_ENV="development"
   PORT="3000"
   DB_CONNECTION_URL="mongodb+srv://<your-username>:<your-password>@cluster.mongodb.net/"
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="<your-access-token-secret>"
   REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET="<your-refresh-token-secret>"
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION="15m"
   REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION="7d"
   ```

## III. Development

Start the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

This command starts the API server and a MongoDB container using docker-compose.

- üåè API Server: http://localhost:3000
- ‚öôÔ∏è Swagger UI: http://localhost:3000/dev/api-docs
- üõ¢Ô∏è MongoDB: mongodb://localhost:27017

## IV. Deployment

**Build and Run without Docker**

```bash
yarn build && yarn start
```

**Run with Docker**

```bash
Copy code
docker build -t sync-workbench-api .
docker run -t -i \
  --env NODE_ENV=production \
  --env DB_CONNECTION_URL=mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017/employees \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  sync-workbench-api
```

**Run with Docker Compose**

```bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
```

## Environment Variables

To configure the application, create a `.env` file in the root directory and copy the contents of `.env.default` as a starting point.

Below are the available environment variables and their descriptions:

| Variable Name              | Type   | Default Value               | Description                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV`                 | string | `development`               | API runtime environment (e.g., `staging`, `production`). |
| `PORT`                     | number | `3000`                      | The port on which the API server runs.                   |
| `DB_CONNECTION_URL`        | string | `db connection url`         | MongoDB connection string.                               |
| `DB_USERNAME`              | string | `eaysinarafat`              | Username for MongoDB authentication.                     |
| `DB_PASSWORD`              | string | `password`                  | Password for MongoDB authentication.                     |
| `APPLICATION_NAME`         | string | `sync-workbench`            | Name of the application.                                 |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`      | string | `your-access-token-secret`  | Secret key used for signing JWT access tokens.           |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`     | string | `your-refresh-token-secret` | Secret key used for signing JWT refresh tokens.          |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION`  | string | `15m`                       | Expiration time for access tokens (e.g., `15m`, `1h`).   |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION` | string | `7d`                        | Expiration time for refresh tokens (e.g., `7d`).         |

### Notes:

- Ensure that sensitive information like `DB_PASSWORD` and token secrets are kept secure and not exposed in your codebase.
- Use environment-specific `.env` files for different deployment environments (e.g., `.env.staging`, `.env.production`).

## Logging

The application uses Winston for logging. Logs are saved in ./logs and in /logs within the Docker container.

- Prettified console logs for development.
- JSON-structured logs for production.
